## Supported OS, oF version

Windows 10, oF 0.10.1, Visual Studio C++ 2017, 64/32 bit

Used Intel Realsense SDK version: Intel.RealSense.SDK-WIN10-2.30.0.1174.

By default, addon is configured to 64 bit.

For switching to 32 bit, comment/uncomment "vs" part of addon_config.mk for enabling 32 bit, and copy to libs/Win32 folder lib and dlls from libs-32-copy-if-need.

During development, I used ideas and links from analogous addons: 
* https://github.com/hiroMTB/ofxRealsense2 
* https://github.com/tecartlab/ofxRSSDK 
* http://www.ofxaddons.com/contributors/tyhenry 

but designed the addon by my own taste.
